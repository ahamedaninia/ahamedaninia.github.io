# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains data science projects completed by me for academic, self-teaching, and curiousity purposes. These projects are completed in either Jupyter Notebooks or R Markdown files.
A majority of these projects were completed during my Masters in Data Science program through Bellevue University.

## Projects

### Database work
[Spotify Database Analysis available](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/spotify-analysis): Obtain data from an API, flat file, and webpage. Combine the three data sources in an SQLite database, and conduct graphical analysis to determine what aspects of a song (bpm, key, cadence, etc) make a song reach the top charts.
  
### Sentiment Analysis
[2020 election sentiment analysis and election prediction using Twitter](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/2020-election-sentiment-analysis): Use natural language processing (NLP) to conduct sentiment analysis on the tweets coming from different US states in an attempt to predict which presidential candidate each state will vote for. These tweets were gathered from the Twitter API from beginning of 2020 to the day before election day.

[NLP Bag of Words sentiment analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/nlp-bagofwords): Practice using a Bag of Words and NLTK's sentiment analyzer tool to determine the polarity of movie reviews.

### Graphical Analysis
[Exam performance analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/school_performance/tree/main): Use exam performance dataset to understand why certain students were performing better than others, and give suggestions as to how to get more students to perform better.

[Customer Support Ticket Analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/customer-support-ticket): Using natural language processing, predicting which relevant department an incoming ticket must be sent to in order to reduce time for ticket to be resolved, therefore increasing customer satisfaction.


### Prediction Analysis
[Diabetes prediction analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/diabetes-disease-prediction/tree/main): Predicting which patients may have diabetes based on various health factors. Increased accuracy via hyperparamter tuning, obtained a 96% accuracy score.

### Other Projects in Python
[Hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/hyperparameter-tuning): Practicing increasing accuracy using Grid Search and Hyperparamter Tuning.

[MNIST-CNN-model](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/MNIST-CNN-model): Showcases using a CNN model for image classification


### Projects in R
[Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/Alzheimers-Disease-Analysis): Predicts which patients have Alzheimer's based on various health factors.
