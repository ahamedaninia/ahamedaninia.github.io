# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains data science projects completed by me for academic, self-teaching, and curiousity purposes. These projects are completed in either Jupyter Notebooks or R Markdown files.
A majority of these projects were completed during my Masters in Data Science program through Bellevue University.

## About Me
My name is Alex Hamedaninia. I graduated from California State Polytechnic University of Pomona (otherwise known as Cal Poly Pomona) with my BS in Mathematics (Pure) in May 2022, and I graduate from Bellevue University in June 2024 with my Masters of Science in Data Science. 

In my very first class at Bellevue, we read a book called “Everybody Lies” by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. This incredible book sparked my interest in discovering unimaginable insights through data exploration. This book has inspired me to embark on every data science project I take on with the idea that we can use data to make insights previously unimaginable — people may lie, but the data does not. 

## Projects

### Database work
[Spotify Database Analysis available](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/spotify-analysis): Obtain data from an API, flat file, and webpage. Combine the three data sources in an SQLite database, and conduct graphical analysis to determine what aspects of a song (bpm, key, cadence, etc) make a song reach the top charts.
  
### Sentiment Analysis
[2020 election sentiment analysis and election prediction using Twitter](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/2020-election-sentiment-analysis): Use natural language processing (NLP) to conduct sentiment analysis on the tweets coming from different US states in an attempt to predict which presidential candidate each state will vote for. These tweets were gathered from the Twitter API from beginning of 2020 to the day before election day.

[NLP Bag of Words sentiment analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/nlp-bagofwords): Practice using a Bag of Words and NLTK's sentiment analyzer tool to determine the polarity of movie reviews.

### Graphical Analysis
[Exam performance analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/school_performance/tree/main): Use exam performance dataset to understand why certain students were performing better than others, and give suggestions as to how to get more students to perform better.

[Customer Support Ticket Analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/customer-support-ticket): Using natural language processing, predicting which relevant department an incoming ticket must be sent to in order to reduce time for ticket to be resolved, therefore increasing customer satisfaction.


### Prediction Analysis
[Diabetes prediction analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/diabetes-disease-prediction/tree/main): Predicting which patients may have diabetes based on various health factors. Increased accuracy via hyperparamter tuning, obtained a 96% accuracy score.

[Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/bank-churn-prediction): Predicting bank customer churn utilizing logistic regression. Utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into why customers are churning, obtained 99.87% accuracy for model.

### Other Projects in Python
[Hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/hyperparameter-tuning): Practicing increasing accuracy using Grid Search and Hyperparamter Tuning.

[MNIST-CNN-model](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/MNIST-CNN-model): Showcases using a CNN model for image classification


### Projects in R
[Alzheimer’s Disease Analysis](https://github.com/ahamedaninia/Alzheimers-Disease-Analysis): Predicts which patients have Alzheimer's based on various health factors.
