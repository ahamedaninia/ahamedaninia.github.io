# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains data science projects completed by me for academic, self-teaching, and curiousity purposes. These projects are completed in either Jupyter Notebooks or R Markdown files.
A majority of these projects were completed during my Masters in Data Science program through Bellevue University.
